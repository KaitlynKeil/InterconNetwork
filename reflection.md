# Reflection

This project was something that originally seemed very daunting initially (before break, when most of us in the group had little clue as to what an interconnection network actually looks like). After we had performed preliminary research, it had actually seemed that we had underscoped with our MVP, but we decided to continue because we had assumed we would be able to get to the other hardware/software implementation we wanted. Thus, we continued to research on the side of our implementation, but assumed we would get farther. Although we did achieve our goal of the MVP, we were still a bit disappointed we couldn’t get farther.

There are numerous reasons we couldn’t get to the hardware implementation, first thing being the fact that our MVP was well-scoped already. Secondly, our schedules had the frustrating ability to be interfering with each other, making it hard to meet. Our communication with each other was fairly good, but could have probably been better. Overall, we are proud of the work we have done, the research we did, the deliverables we created, and the knowledge we learned - with the caveat that, if we could do this a second time, there are definitely ways to make our work process more streamlined (or should I say, pipelined).
